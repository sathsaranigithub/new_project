Our fate as a species depends on the state of our
 most important habitat – land. Our future is linked
 to the survival of land ecosystems. Through photosynthesis, 
plants provide the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat and 
are thus the foundation of most life on Earth.</p>
<h3>if we talk about the brief about  extinction of various species</h3><br>
<p>
When we talk about extinctions, we need to understand 
that it’s not just about the disappearance of a single specie 
but also the effects of its disappearance to the environment that  
it interacts with. It’s a broad topic. Concerned groups and governments
 are trying to save these endangered species through breeding and preserving 
their habitat – but these are all temporary solutions. What we need to do is to address
 the root causes of extinction of species.

<h3>
if we talk brief  about aquatic ecosystems and terrestrial ecosystems</h3>
<p>
An ecosystem is a community of plants, animals and
 other living organisms that share the benefits of a particular
 space or environment such as air, food, water and soil. It’s 
no different from our human community where every citizen 
of a city relies on its own resources and interacts with its environment.
<br>
In an ecosystem, each organism has its role and purpose.  
Disturbing the balance of an ecosystem can be disastrous 
for all the living things relying on it. An example of an ecosystem
 are Coral Reefs but there are much smaller ecosystems. Each 
ecosystem differ in size and components, but the important thing
 to remember is that no matter the size, it’s a symbiotic community.

<h2><li>increase urbanization and loss bio diversity and loss of habit</li></h2>

<p>In the 21st century, few trends have matched the economic, environmental, and
 societal impact of rapid urbanization.
More than half of the world’s population now live in urban areas — increasingly
 in highly-dense cities. However, urban settings are a relatively new phenomenon in 
human history. This transition has transformed the way we live, work, travel and build 
networks.</p>

<br/>
<p>The rise of urbanization greatly reduced biodiversity when large areas of natural habitat are fragmented.
The interactions between urbanization with biodiversity and 
ecosystem services that take place defy simple generalizations.
 There is increasing evidence for the negative impacts of urbanization
 on biodiversity, most directly in the form of habitat loss and fragmentation.
More than half of the world’s population now live in urban areas — increasingly in highly-dense cities.

<h2><em>urbanization is one of the most intensive and rapid human-driven factors that threat biodiversity.</em></h2>
<p>Biodiversity loss includes the worldwide extinction of different species, as 
well as the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat, resulting in a loss of biological diversity.
Biodiversity loss includes the worldwide extinction of different species, 
as well as the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat, resulting 
in a loss of biological diversity. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or 
permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads
 to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration/ecological resilience or
 effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). The current global extinction
 (frequently called the sixth mass extinction or Anthropocene extinction), has
 resulted in a biodiversity crisis being driven by human activities which push
 beyond the planetary boundaries and so far has proven irreversible
Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic and tragic 
phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes
 from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the 
food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire
 chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible 
alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects 
of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in
 particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate
 danger for food security, but also can have more lasting public health consequences 
for humans.

<p><h3><strong>Habitat loss—due to destruction,
 fragmentation, or degradation of habitat—is 
the primary threat to the survival of wildlife in the 
United States. When an ecosystem has been dramatically
 changed by human activities—such as agriculture, oil 
and gas exploration, commercial development, or water 
diversion—it may no longer be able to provide the food, 
water, cover, and places to raise young that wildlife need to survive. 
Every day there are fewer places left that wildlife can call home.</strong></h3>

<h2><li>natural desasters</li></h2>

<p>A natural disaster is a major adverse event resulting 
from natural processes of the Earth; examples include firestorms,
 duststorms, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions,
 earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, and other geologic processes. 
A natural disaster can cause loss of life or damage property,[1] 
and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake, the severity 
of which depends on the affected population's resilience and on the
 infrastructure available.
<br/>
During the last few years, there has been an increase in the reports
 of natural disasters as well as destruction caused due to these disasters. 
The tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes, which hit parts of Asia and the
 Americas in 2004/2005 are some examples of natural disasters in past few
 years and floods in the parts of Uttarakhand is a recent example of the destruction
 caused due to these natural calamities. These calamities have led to the displacement 
of a lot of people and heavy loss of life as well as the property was also reported. 
Not just these few cases, natural disasters can be of many types which may include 
volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods, drought, landslides, or earthquakes etc.

<h2><li> climate change.</li></h2>
<p>Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th
 century to the human expansion of the "greenhouse effect"1 — warming that 
results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.
On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the
 last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the
 concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because
 the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to
 make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, 
and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.
Outside of a greenhouse, higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels can
 have both positive and negative effects on crop yields. Some laboratory experiments 
suggest that elevated CO2 levels can increase plant growth. However, other factors, such
 as changing temperatures, ozone, and water and nutrient constraints, may more than
counteract anypotential increase in yield. If optimal temperature ranges for some crops
 are exceeded, earlier possible gains in field may be reduced or reversed altogether.
<br/>
<br/><br/>
<img  src="climate1.jpeg"/>
<h3><b>Climate extremes, such as droughts, floods and extreme temperatures, can lead
 to crop losses and threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the food 
security of communities worldwide. Depending on the crop and ecosystem, weeds,
 pests, and fungi can also thrive under warmer temperatures, wetter climates, and 
increased CO2 levels, and climate change will likely increase weeds and pests.
In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
 a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world
 under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 95 percent 
probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.

The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised 
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to about 417 parts
 per million in the last 151 years. The panel also concluded there's a better than
 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon 
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase
 in Earth's temperatures over the past 50-plus years.
It's reasonable to assume that changes in the Sun's energy
 output would cause the climate to change, since the Sun is the 
fundamental source of energy that drives our climate system.

Indeed, studies show that solar variability has played a role in 
past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity
 coupled with an increase in volcanic activity is thought to have 
helped trigger the Little Ice Age between approximately 1650 
and 1850, when Greenland cooled from 1410 to the 1720s and 
glaciers advanced in the Alps.

Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. 
Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere 
and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature
 are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, 
which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as
 "feedbacks."

<h2><li>desertification  and extinction of species</li></h2>

<p>Desertification can be defined as land degradation
 implying the loss of biological productivity due to the 
development of land into an arid desert-like environment.Desertification is a big global problem, 
which will become even worse due to the effects of global warming.

Millions of people will likely lose their livelihood and will have to
 migrate to foreign countries in order to survive.</p>
<img  src="species02.jpeg"/>
<p>Researchers at the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification 
(UNCCD COP 14) have warned that if desertification and the improper use of land continues at the current 
rate, it would lead to the extinction of many critically endangered species.

The Indian Cheetah and the pink-headed duck have been extinct for decades, 
as reported by The Hindu, primarily due to man-made factors such as hunting, 
habitat degradation, and predation. Now, other species face the threat of extinction as well.

“We have a database for more than 5.6 million specimens, collected from all 
over India and also from the neighbouring countries before Independence. 
They give a lot of information about how things have changed in more than 
100 years,” Kailash Chandra, director of the Zoological Survey of India told ANI.

He added, “If you see their distribution in geo-spatial platforms, you'll 
realise how many changes have occurred because of the impact of deforestation and desertification.”

<h2><li>water and air pollution</li></h2>
<img  src="pollution01.jpeg"/>
<p>Air pollution directly affects the health of humans and
 animals alike. The air humans and animals breathe is directed 
to the lungs and as such the pollutants present in the air 
directly get into the lungs and can lead to lung cancers. 
In the case of animals, several cases of deaths related to 
air pollution have been witnessed in different parts of the
 world. Also, birds have been severely affected by the air 
pollution because they have to be at the core of the polluted air.
 In recent times, air pollution has been of such several levels that
breathing in that air was equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes 
in a day. Air pollution is also very harmful to crops and other agricultural
 products because when air is highly polluted and rain starts pouring, 
the rain pours in the form of Acid rain. The acid rain pours on people
 who are out, the crop produces and finally gets added into the ground
. The acid rain can cause skin allergies if exposure to such rain is prolonged 
and can also damage the crop if caution is not exercised. The addition of 
acid rain into the groundwater disrupts the PH of the groundwater and as 
a result the groundwater also gets polluted.

<br/>

<p>Water pollution is a critical concern because the pollution
 in water bodies has an extremely severe effect on the lives of 
aquatic animals and it totally leads to the disruption of aquatic 
ecosystems there. The huge presence of plastics, water bottles, 
and polythenes can cause fatal conditions for aquatic animals. 
Also, the increased water pollution has disturbed the PH level 
of the water bodies and as a result, water at some points in 
these water bodies has become so poisonous or acidic that
 fishes, dolphins, and penguins have often been seen dead at the sea, 
river shores.  </p>

<br/>
<p>Air and Water pollution both are very harmful to human existence on this planet. 
Air and water are the most precious natural resources which are present in abundance 
but we misuse and abuse them. The pollution in any of these has a serious effect on the
 lives of humans and animals alike. Air and water pollution if abused to the maximum
level can’t be turned back on immediately, several diseases and disorders previously
 unknown to humans have been identified as a consequence of air and water getting
 polluted with poisonous substances which are released from chemical and other such
 environment degrading industries. Like humans, the health of the planet is also getting 
affected when we choke the air it breezes and pollute the water that flows on it. </p>
