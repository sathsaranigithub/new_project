        <h1>How To Reduce Deforestation </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        
        <p>Deforestation isn’t simply the loss of a helpful resource however additionally results in many different environmental problems like life destruction, erosion, flooding, and in particular, global climate change. to not forget that trees are one of all the best carbon sinks in the world. They soak up dioxide and provide out O through a method referred to as chemical action. inline with AN estimate, the Amazon forest is liable for concerning two-hundredths of the world’s O.

If we have a tendency to don’t minimize deforestation, the results are attending to be unfortunate. an oversized variety of animal and plant species can go extinct, the air can become unsuitable for respiratory, greenhouse emission emissions can increase, the temperature can rise to many degrees, and far additional. In short, the planet can now not be an area for all times to sustain.

        <p>
           One of the foremost convenient and easy approaches for overcoming the difficulty of deforestation is tree plantation. It’s sort of a period of time investment. The seeds planted can grow into trees at some unspecified time in the future and should recover the loss visage through deforestation. What proportion you wish to contribute is your call to create. Begin from one tree or 2 or maybe decide to plant an entire forest. Take the instance of ‘ADAV Paying’ from Mali United Nations agency is thought because the ‘Forest Man of India’. Over many decades, he planted one tree day after day and thus with success engineered an entire forest comprising a section of 1400 acres.

        <h2>Minimize Paper Consumption</h2>
        <img src="img/deforestation 2.jpg" alt="2" width="400" height="300" border="2">
        <p>
According to WWF, the pulp and paper industry, as being one of the largest global industries, is greatly affecting the forests of the world. The production of products such as paper, tissue, and packaging is responsible for the utilization of 40% industrial wood globally. This harvesting of trees for the pulp and paper industry imposes some serious threats to the forest ecosystems.
It doesn’t end here. The demand for paper increases up to 2-3% every year, which leads to illegal logging, and hence, more and more trees are being chopped down. Minimize the use of paper and reduce its demand for the protection of trees. Avoid excessive printing, use both sides of the paper for printing or writing, and stick to emails than regular mails.

        <h2>Reduce, reuse, and recycle</h2>
        <img src="deforestation 3.jpg"  alt="3" width="400" height="300" border="2">
        <p>
Reduce, reuse, and recycle are the 3 Rs of waste management. The idea is to preserve resources by minimizing the overall amount of waste produced by reducing consumption and promoting reuse and recycling of products. Take paper for example. A paper that has been printed on one side can be reused for writing on the other side. This act will not only promote reusing but also reducing. 

It has been estimated that recycling 1 ton of paper can save 17 trees. These 17 trees can capture around 250 pounds of CO2 annually. Buy those paper products that have been recycled or at least those that can be recycled. Recycled and recyclable products are always labeled accordingly. The same applies to other wood or wood-derived products.

        <h2>Make your yard wildlife friendly</h2>
        <img src="wildlife 3.jpeg" width="400" height="300" border="2">
        <p>

1.Plant native species of flowers, trees, and bushes in your yard. This gives wild animals food, shelter, and a place to raise families. Learn more about creating wildlife habitat in your yard. 
<br><br>2.To attract birds to your yard, learn which native plant species are best for your location. 
<br><br>3.To attract butterflies and moths to your yard, learn which native plant species are best for your location.
To help imperiled monarch butterflies survive, plant native milkweed. Learn which species of milkweed are native to your region, and find milkweed suppliers in your area. 
<br><br>4.Reduce the amount of lawn in your yard. Lawns offer minimal food and shelter for wildlife. Try replacing part of your lawn with garden beds or native plants and flowers instead.
<br><br>5.Get crafty! Buy or build your own birdhouse or bat house. This can provide hours of fun for the whole family.
<br><br>6.No yard? No problem! Balconies and patios are great locations for container gardens.
<br><br>7.Do not use pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, or chemical fertilizers on your lawn or garden beds. These products are the leading cause of wildlife poisonings, and are also toxic to companion animals.
<br><br>8.Reduce light pollution: artificial light at night has severe negative effects on wildlife. To help, only use lighting when and where it is needed, properly shield all outdoor lights, keep your blinds drawn during the evening, and if safety is a concern, install motion detector lights and timers.
