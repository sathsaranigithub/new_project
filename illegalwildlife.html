        <h2>Illegal Wildlife Trade</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p class="detail">  Wildlife crime is a big business. Run by dangerous international networks, wildlife and animal parts are
            trafficked much like illegal
            drugs and arms. By its very nature, it is almost impossible to obtain reliable figures for the value of the
            illegal wildlife trade. Experts at
            TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, estimate that it runs into billions of dollars.
            <br>
            Some examples of illegal wildlife trade are well known, such as poaching of elephants for ivory and tigers
            for their skins and bones.
            However, countless other species are similarly overexploited, from marine turtles to timber trees. Not all
            wildlife trade is illegal. Wild
            plants and animals from tens of thousands of species are caught or harvested from the wild and then sold
            legitimately as food, pets, ornamental plants,
            leather, tourist ornaments and medicine. Wildlife
            trade escalates into a crisis when an increasing proportion is illegal and unsustainable—directly
            threatening the survival of many species in the wild.
            <br>
            Stamping out wildlife crime is a priority for WWF because it`s the largest direct threat to the future of
            many of the world’s most threatened species.
            It is second only to habitat destruction in overall threats against species survival.

        <h2>CAUSES</h2>
        <img src="img/07.jpg" width="400" height="200" border="2" align="left">
        <p class="detail">
            As human populations have grown, so has the demand for wildlife. People in many countries are accustomed to
            a lifestyle
            which fuels demand for wildlife. They expect access to a variety of seafoods, leather goods, timbers,
            medicinal ingredients
            and textiles. At the other end, extreme poverty means some people see wildlife as valuable barter for trade.
            <br><br>
            
         DEMAND DRIVES CRIME........
         <br>
        Rhino horn, elephant ivory and tiger products continue to command high prices among consumers, especially in
        Asia. In Vietnam,
        the recent myth that rhino horn can cure cancer has led to massive poaching in South Africa and pushed the price
        of rhino horn to rival gold.
        <br><br>
        GAPS IN PROTECTION........
        <br>
        Corruption, toothless laws, weak judicial systems and light sentences allow criminal networks to keep plundering
        wildlife with little regard
        to consequences. These factors make illegal wildlife trade a low risk business with high returns. The
        poachers—often poor locals—are the usually
        the only ones caught, leaving the real masterminds and their network safe and operational with the ability to
        strike again.
        <br><br>
        HIGH PROFIT MARGINS........
       <Br>
        Illegal wildlife trade is driven by high profit margins and, in many cases, the high prices paid for rare
        species. Vulnerable wild animals are
        pushed further to the edge of extinction when nature can’t replenish their stocks to keep up with the rate of
        human consumption.

        <h2>IMPACTS</h2>
        <img src="img/09.jpg" width="800" height="400" border="2">
        <p class="detail">

            
            There are certain places in the world where wildlife trade is particularly threatening. These areas are
            called “wildlife trade hotspots.”
            They include China's international borders, trade hubs in East/Southern Africa and Southeast Asia, the
            eastern borders of the European
            Union, some markets in Mexico, parts of the Caribbean, parts of Indonesia and New Guinea, and the Solomon
            Islands. While these hotspots
            might be trouble areas at present, they also offer opportunities for great conservation success, if action
            and funds are well-focused.
            Wildlife trade alone is a major threat to some species, but its impact is frequently made worse by habitat
            loss and other pressures.
            <br><br>

            ALTERING LIVELIHOODS.....
<br>
            Local wildlife is considered an important resource by many communities, often the poorest, in the developing
            world. Some rural households
            depend on wild animals for protein, trees for fuel, and both wild animals and plants for natural cures.
            <br><br>
            INTERRUPTION OF NATURE.....
<br>
            Overexploitation of species affects the living planet in wider ways. Just as overfishing causes imbalances
            in the whole marine system,
            our complex web of life on earth depends on careful and thoughtful use of wildlife species and their
            habitats.
            <br><br>
            INVASIVE SPECIES.....
<br>
            Many invasive species have been purposely introduced by wildlife traders or buyers. These invasive species
            prey on or compete with
            native species and are a major threat to the balance of nature. For example pet Burmese pythons let loose by
            their owners are now
            considered a major pest in Florida`s everglades.
<br><br>
            INCIDENTAL KILLING OF NON-TARGET SPECIES......
            <br>
            Like marine species killed through bycatch, incidental killing of animals also happens on land. For example,
            crude traps set for musk deer or duikers cause damage and death to a variety of animals besides those intended.

            <br><br>
            COMPROMISED SECURITY
            <br>
            The very existence of illegal trade undermines efforts made by countries to protect their natural resources. 
            Illegal wildlife trade is run by criminal networks with wide, international reach. Some traffic illegal drugs,
             arms and even people. Recent evidence shows that some networks are also linked to terrorist organizations.
