<h3>Deforestation is a major cause of soil erosion, 
perhaps the main cause. </h3>
<p>Deforestation can be defined as the large-scale removal
 of trees from forests (or other lands) for the facilitation 
of human activities.<br/>
It is a serious environmental concern since it can result
 in the loss of biodiversity, damage to natural habitats, 
disturbances in the water cycle, and soil erosion. Deforestation
 is also a contributor to climate change and global warming.
