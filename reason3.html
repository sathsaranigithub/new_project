<h1>release of waste into the environment by careless disposal</h1>
<p>The waste humans generate waste has been
 detrimental to our environment for quite some time now. 
Humans are generating too much trash and cannot deal with 
it in a sustainable way. </p>

<p>Waste that is not biodegradable and cannot be properly
 be recycled is filling our oceans and landfills. Letâ€™s take 
plastic waste as an example. A recent study found that of 
the 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic waste that has been produced,
 only 9% of that plastic waste had been recycled. (Find out more 
about plastic pollution and how you can help reduce your own waste.) 
in 2017, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency
 calculated that the total generation of municipal solid waste 
in the United States just that year was 267.8 million tons. Compared
 with 2015 levels, it was a 5.7 million increase. All together, the amount
 of waste generated affects the environment in multiple ways: its 
contribution to the worsening climate crisis, its negative impact on 
wildlife and the natural environment, and its detriment to our very 
own public health.</p>
